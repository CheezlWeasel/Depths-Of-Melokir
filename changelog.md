## Removed spells
17 spells have had class sources removed and will no longer show up when filtering by any of the classes, they are as follows:
### AAG
- Air Bubble
- Create Spelljamming Helm
###  AI
- Distort Value
- Fast Friends
- Gift of Gab
- Jim's Glowing Coin
### GGR
- Encode Thoughts
### IDRotF
- Create Magen
### PHB
- Animate Dead
- Fabricate
- Finger of Death
- Forcecage
- Plane Shift
- Simulacrum
### SCC
- Borrowed Knowledge
- Kinetic Jaunt
- Silvery Barbs

The reason these spells were not outright deleted is that while these spells are banned usage for **players** the DM's are still able to have NPC's and Monsters utilise these spells. As such they are simply no longer considered valid for any class.

If a background, species, subclass or feat references one of these spells it will still show up. Animate Dead is one of these spells
