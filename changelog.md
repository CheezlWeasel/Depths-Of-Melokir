More items have been added to the shop

# v1.2.5
Credits

All of the Homebrew Subclasses, Species and the Lictor Class have had Credits for which individuals wrote what or where they were sourced from. 
All of the Homebrew Classes and Subclasses have had notes attached indicating that multiclassing in any form is not allowed with them (With Lictor, Pugilist and Illrigger this has been added in the Multiclassing Prerequisite Tab on the left side of the page)
Oath of Liberty has had its Tenets Added
Lictor has had its Flavor Text at the start of the class added

Variant Class Features will not have credits added as they are more often than not a collaborative effort between people and it is quite honestly a hastle to track down each individual feature's writers

An External Service is now pinging the website every couple minutes. It should no longer spin down

## Removed spells
17 spells have had class sources removed and will no longer show up when filtering by any of the classes, they are as follows:
### AAG
- Air Bubble
- Create Spelljamming Helm
###  AI
- Distort Value
- Fast Friends
- Gift of Gab
- Jim's Glowing Coin
### GGR

### PHB
- Animate Dead
- Fabricate

The reason these spells were not outright deleted is that while these spells are banned usage for **players** the DM's are still able to have NPC's and Monsters utilise these spells. As such they are simply no longer considered valid for any class.

If a background, species, subclass or feat references one of these spells it will still show up. Animate Dead is one of these spells
